This data set includes information about the superstore items purchased by different custromers, type of items etc.
Data structure: This csv file include 51290 rows and 21 coloumns.

In my opinion the following questions are the most important question in the data set.

1. What is the overall sales trend?
2. What are the top 10 products by sales?
3. Which are the most selling products?
4. Which is the most preffered ship mode?
5. Which are the most profitable category and sub-category?
